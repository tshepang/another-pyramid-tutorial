********************
A better WSGI server
********************

The server we used in the preceding chapter is part of the standard library,
so was used for convenience.
It is more of a demo server than something that would be used in production.
I want us to get rid of it and used something billed as *production quality*.

installation
============

Assuming that you in the :term:`virtualenv`, run the following::

    pip install waitress

If the following does not display any output,
then :mod:`Waitress <waitress>` is most likely properly installed::

    python -c 'import wairess'


greeting the world once more
============================

The changes are emphasized/highlighted:

.. literalinclude:: src/ch02.py
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 22

Run that code, then visit http://localhost:8080,
which should display the famous greeting in your web browser.

whats new
=========

- I don't know about you, but I prefer the API;
  it's so much cleaner (and asks for less code)

- Waitress conveniently displays the url at which the app is reachable:

  .. code-block:: text

     serving on http://0.0.0.0:8080

- The terminal output of the app is more quite,
  unless the previous code, where each request
  (visiting http://localhost:8080) displayed this output:

  .. code-block:: text

     127.0.0.1 - - [21/Apr/2013 14:08:05] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 12
     127.0.0.1 - - [21/Apr/2013 14:08:05] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 164

- If you insert a ``print(request)`` in the View,
  like I did in the precedding chapter,
  you will notice a slight difference in the output:

  .. code-block:: text

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
     Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
     Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
     Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
     Cache-Control: max-age=0
     Host: localhost:8080
     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.31 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/26.0.1410.63 Safari/537.31

  The response will be exactly the same. Try it and see for yourself.
