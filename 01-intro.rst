why another tutorial
====================

There are a few Pyramid tutorials out there;
some are part of the :ref:`official documentation <index>`,
and some are part of the :ref:`pyramid-tutorials` collection.
So why one more? Two reasons:

* A tutorial I would have loved to read when I first came across
  the web framework;
  I prefer a gentler approach than what I've seen so far.

* An excuse for me to learn Pyramid (and web technologies) more thoroughly;
  I want to get to a point where I am competent enough to build a simple
  clone of `Stack Overflow`__.
