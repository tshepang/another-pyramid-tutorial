Testing the app
***************

Before our app gets any more complex, let us test it a bit:

.. literalinclude:: src/ch03.py
   :emphasize-lines: 13

Change the emphasized line to match the actual module you used for the
code in the preceeding chapter. I named my module to match the chapter,
but would have used something more meaningful otherwise.

The result of running the app should look like:

.. code-block:: text

   .
