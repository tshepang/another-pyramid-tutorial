Adding routes
*************

Let's see how another route is added:

.. literalinclude:: src/ch04.py
   :emphasize-lines: 13-15, 21

- Look at the (emphasized) differences; they should be easy to digest.

- Visit both http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8080/bye,
  to see if you get what you expected.

- If it's not as clear as you wish, revisit the :ref:`getting_started` chapter.

testing
=======

We need to add one more test case to cover the new View:

.. literalinclude:: src/ch04a.py
   :emphasize-lines: 14, 19-23

- This is just one more, and very similar test method, as the last chapter,
  so should not need explaining.

- Running the script, you will now see two dots, representing the two
  test cases, ``test_hello`` and ``test_goodbye``.

- Here's the output of running the script with ``--verbose``
  command-line option:

  .. code-block:: text

     test_goodbye (__main__.Test) ... ok
     test_hello (__main__.Test) ... ok

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ran 2 tests in 0.073s

     OK
